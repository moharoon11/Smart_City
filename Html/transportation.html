<h2>The Seven Facets of the Urban Transport Problem </h2>

<h2>1. Traffic Movement and Congestion:</h2><br> 

<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">Traffic congestion occurs when urban transport networks are no longer capable of accommodating the volume of movements that use them. The location of congested areas is determined by the physical transport framework and by the patterns of urban land use and their associated trip-generating activities. Levels of traffic overloading vary in time, with a very well-marked peak during the daily journey-to-work periods.

Although most congestion can be attributed to overloading, there are other aspects of this basic problem that also require solutions. In the industrialised countries increasing volumes of private car, public transport and commercial vehicle traffic have exposed the inadequacies of urban roads, especially in older city centres where street patterns have survived largely unaltered from the nineteenth century and earlier.


The intricate nature of these centres makes motorised movements difficult and long-term car parking almost impossible. In developing countries the problem is particularly acute: Indian and South-East Asian cities often have cores composed of a mesh of narrow streets often accessible only to non-motorised traffic.

The rapid growth in private car ownership and use in western cities in the period since 1950 has rarely been accompanied by a corre­sponding upgrading of the road network, and these increases will probably continue into the twenty-first century, further exacerbating the problem. In less-developed countries car ownership in urban areas is in at a much lower level but there is evidence of an increased rate in recent decades, especially in South America and South-East Asia (Rimmer, 1977).

Satis­factory definitions of the saturation level of car ownership vary but if a ratio of 50 cars to 100 persons is taken then in several US cities the figure is now over 80 per 100, whereas in South-East Asian cities the level rarely exceeds 10 per 100. One factor contributing to congestion in developing world cities is the uncontrolled intermixing of motorised and animal-or human-drawn vehicles. The proliferation of pedal and motor­cycles causes particular difficulties (Simon 1996).
</p>

<h2>2. Public Transport Crowding:</h2><br> 

<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">The ‘person congestion’ occurring inside public transport vehicles at such peak times adds insult to injury, sometimes literally. A very high proportion of the day’s journeys are made under conditions of peak-hour loading, during which there will be lengthy queues at stops, crowding at terminals, stairways and ticket offices, and excessively long periods of hot and claus­trophobic travel jammed in overcrowded vehicles.

In Japan, ‘packers’ are employed on station platforms to ensure that passengers are forced inside the metro trains so that the automatic doors can close properly. Throughout the world, conditions are difficult on good days, intolerable on bad ones and in some cities in developing countries almost unbelievable every day. Images of passengers hanging on to the outside of trains in India are familiar enough. Quite what conditions are like inside can only be guessed at?

<h2>3. Off-Peak Inadequacy of Public Transport:</h2><br> 

If public transport operators provide sufficient vehicles to meet peak-hour demand there will be insufficient patronage off-peak to keep them economically employed. If on the other hand they tailor fleet size to the off-peak demand, the vehicles would be so overwhelmed during the peak that the service would most likely break down.


This disparity of vehicle use is the hub of the urban transport problem for public transport operators. Many now have to maintain sufficient vehicles, plant and labour merely to provide a peak-hour service, which is a hopelessly uneconomic use of resources. Often the only way of cutting costs is by reducing off-peak services, but this in turn drives away remaining patronage and encourages further car use. This ‘off-peak problem’ does not, however, afflict operators in devel­oping countries. There, rapidly growing urban populations with low car ownership levels provide sufficient off-peak demand to keep vehicle occupancy rates high throughout the day.

<h2>4. Difficulties for Pedestrians:</h2><br> 
</p>
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">Pedestrians form the largest category of traffic accident victims. Attempts to increase their safety have usually failed to deal with the source of the problem (i.e., traffic speed and volume) and instead have concentrated on restricting movement on foot. Needless to say this worsens the pedestrian’s environment, making large areas ‘off-limits’ and forcing walkers to use footbridges and underpasses, which are inadequately cleaned or policed. Additionally there is obstruction by parked cars and the increasing pollution of the urban environment, with traffic noise and exhaust fumes affecting most directly those on feet.

At a larger scale, there is the problem of access to facilities and activities in the city. The replacement of small-scale and localised facilities such as shops and clinics by large-scale super­stores and hospitals serving larger catchment areas has put many urban activities beyond the reach of the pedestrian. These greater distances between residences and needed facilities can only be covered by those with motorised transport. Whereas the lack of safe facilities may be the biggest problem for the walker in developing countries, in advanced countries it is the growing inability to reach ‘anything’ on foot, irrespective of the quality of the walking environment.
</p>
<h2>5. Parking Difficulties:</h2><br> 

<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">Many car drivers stuck in city traffic jams are not actually trying to go anywhere: they are just looking for a place to park. For them the parking problem is the urban transport problem: earning enough to buy a car is one thing but being smart enough to find somewhere to park it is quite another. However, it is not just the motorist that suffers. Cities are disfigured by ugly multi-storey parking garages and cityscapes are turned into seas of metal, as vehicles are crammed on to every square metre of ground.

Public transport is slowed by clogged streets and movement on foot in anything like a straight line becomes impossible. The provision of adequate car parking space within or on the margins of central business districts (CBDs) for city workers and shoppers is a problem that has serious implications for land use planning.


A prolifer­ation of costly and visually intrusive multi-storey car-parks can only provide a partial solution and supplementary on-street parking often compound road congestion. The extension of pedestrian precincts and retail malls in city centres is intended to provide more acceptable environments for shoppers and other users of city centres. However, such traffic-free zones in turn produce problems as they create new patterns of access to commercial centres for car-borne travellers and users of public transport, while the latter often lose their former advantage of being conveyed directly to the central shopping area.

</p>
<h2>6. Environmental Impact:</h2><br> 

<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">The operation of motor vehicles is a polluting activity. While there are innumerable other activities which cause environ­mental pollution as a result of the tremendous increases in vehicle ownership, society is only now beginning to appreciate the devastating and dangerous consequences of motor vehicle usage. Pollution is not the only issue.

Traffic noise is a serious problem in the central area of our towns and cities and there are other environmental drawbacks brought about through trying to accommodate increasing traffic volumes. The vast diver­gence between private and social costs is one, which has so far been allowed to continue without any real check. Perhaps more disturbing is that society is largely unaware of the longer-term effects of such action, and while the motorcar is by no means the only culprit, it is a persistently obvious offender.

Traffic Noise:<br> 

It is generally recognised that traffic noise is the major environment problem caused by traffic in urban areas. Noise became a pressing problem late in the 1950s and in 1960 the Government set up a committee to look into the whole issue. This committee, headed by Sir Alan Wilson, pointed out with reference to London that traffic noise “is the predominant source of annoyance and no other single noise is of comparable importance”.


Traffic noise is both annoying and disturbing. Walking and other activities in urban areas can be harassing and, perhaps more important, traffic noise penetrates through to the interior of buildings. Working is therefore more difficult since noise disturbs concentration and conversation. High noise levels can also disturb domestic life as sleeping and relax­ation become affected.

Traffic noise tends to be a continuous sound, which is unwanted by the hearer. It is caused as a result of fluctuations in air pressure, which are then picked up by the human ear. Whilst other noise phenomena such as aircraft noise and vibra­tions from a road drill produce a more intense sound, traffic noise is a much more continuous and an almost round-the-clock discomfort. Noise is usually measured on a weighted scale in decibel units, an increase of 10 dB corre­sponding to a doubling of loudness.

The Wilson Committee published studies, which showed that a decibel noise level of 84 dB was much as people found acceptable and they proposed legislation which would make any engine noise more than 85 dB, illegal. They proposed that there should be a progressive reduction in acceptable limits, but this has not been achieved. In fact, heavy lorries produce a noise level still well in excess of the above acceptable level.

The noise from motor vehicles comes from various sources. The engine, exhaust and tyres are the most important ones but with goods vehicles, additional noise can be given off by the body, brakes, loose fittings and aerodynamic noise. The level of noise is also influenced by the speed of the vehicle, the density of the traffic flow and the nature of the road surface on which the vehicle is operating.

Vehicles, which are accelerating or travelling on an uphill surface, produce more noise than those moving in a regular flow on an even road. The regulations now in force lay down the limits of 84 dB for cars and 89 dB for Lorries. Buses, particularly when stopping and starting, motor­cycles and sports cars as well as goods vehicles produce higher noise levels than the average private car.
</p>
<h2>7. Atmospheric Pollution:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
Fumes from motor vehicles present one of the most unpleasant costs of living with the motor vehicle. The car is just one of many sources of atmospheric pollution and although prolonged exposure may constitute a health hazard, it is important to view this particular problem in perspective. As the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has stated, “there is no firm evidence that in Britain the present level of these pollutants is a hazard to health”.

Traffic fumes, especially from poorly maintained diesel engines, can be very offensive and added to noise contribute to the unpleasantness of walking in urban areas. No urban street is free from the effects of engine fumes and these almost certainly contribute towards the formation of smog. As traffic volumes increase, however, atmospheric pollution will also increase. In the United States, with its much higher levels of vehicle ownership, there is mounting concern over the effects of vehicle fumes. In large cities such as Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo, fumes are responsible for the creation of very unpleasant smog.,

<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
The following common steps may be helpful in solving the problems of urban
transport:<br> 
           <ol style="font-size:22px;"> 
            <li> Development of Additional Road Capacity</li>
            <li>  Traffic Management Measures</li>
            <li>  Effective Use of Bus Service</li>
            <li> Parking Restrictions</li>
            <li>Promoting the Bicycle</li>
            <li> Encouraging Walking</li>
            <li>Promoting Public Transport</li>
            <li> Other Measures</li>
           </ol>
</p>

         <h2>1. Development of Additional Road Capacity:</h2><br> 
         <p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
One of the most commonly adopted methods of combatting road congestion 
in medium and small towns or in districts of larger centres is the 
construction of bypasses to divert through-traffic. This practice has 
been followed throughout the world including India. Mid-twentieth 
century planners saw the construction of additional road capacity in the 
form of new or improved highways as the acceptable solution to 
congestion within major towns and cities.Since the pioneer 
transportation studies of the 1950s and 1960s were carried out 
in the US metropolitan areas, where the needs of an auto-dominated 
society were seen to be paramount, the provision of additional road 
capacity was accepted for several decades as the most effective solution 
to congestion, and urban freeways were built in large cities such as Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Western European transport planners incorporated many of their American 
counterparts’ concepts into their own programmes and the urban motorway featured in many of the larger schemes (Muller, 1995). However, it soon became evident that the generated traffic on these new roads rapidly reduced the initial advantages.
The construction of an urban motorway network with its access junctions requires large areas of land and the inevitable demolition of tracts of housing and commercial properties. By the 1970s planners and policy­makers came to accept that investment in new highways dedicated to the rapid movement of motor traffic was not necessarily the most effective solution to urban transport problems.
</p>
<h2>2. Traffic Management Measures:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
  Temporary and partial relief from road traffic congestion may be gained 
from the introduction of traffic management schemes, involving he 
reorganisation of traffic flows and direc­tions without any major 
structural alterations to the existing street pattern. Among the most 
widely used devices are the extension of one-way systems, the phasing of 
traffic-light controls to take account of traffic variation, and restrictions on parking and vehicle loading on major roads.
On multi-lane highways that carry heavy volumes of commuter traffic, 
certain lanes can be allocated to incoming vehicles in the morning and 
to outgoing traffic in the afternoon, producing a tidal-flow effect. 
Recent experiments using information technology have been based upon 
intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS), with the computerised control 
of traffic lights and entrances to freeways, advice to drivers of 
alternative routes to avoid congestion, and information on weather and 
general road conditions. The IVHS can be linked up with advanced vehicle 
control systems, making use of in-car computer to eliminate driver error
and control automatic braking and steering when accidents are imminent.
Traffic management has been extensively applied within urban residential 
areas, where excessive numbers of vehicles produce noise, vibration, 
pollution and, above all, accident risks, especially to the young. 
‘Traffic calming’ has been intro­duced to many European cities and aims 
at the creation of an environment in which cars are permitted but where 
the pedes­trian has priority of movement. Carefully planned street-width 
variations, parking restrictions and speed-control devices such as ramps 
are combined to secure a safe and acceptable balance between car and 
pedestrian.</p>

<h2>3. Effective Use of Bus Service:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
Many transportation planning proposals are aimed specifically at 
increasing the speed and schedule reliability of bus services, and many 
European cities have introduced bus priority plans in an attempt to 
increase the attractions of public transport. Bus-only lanes, with or 
against the direction of traffic flow, are designated in heavily congested
roads to achieve time savings, although such savings may later be 
dissipated when buses enter inner-city areas where priority lanes at 
intersections and certain streets may be restricted to buses only,
particularly in pedestrianised shopping zones.
Where entirely new towns are planned, there is an oppor­tunity to 
incorporate separate bus networks within the urban road system, enabling 
buses to operate free from congestion. In the UK, Runcorn New Town, 
built as an overspill centre for the Merseyside conurbation, was provided
with a double- looped busway linking shopping centre, industrial estates 
and housing areas.About 90 per cent of the town’s population was within 
five minutes’ walk of the busway and operating costs were 33 per cent less than those of buses on the conventional roads. Although the system is not used to the extent originally envisaged, it successfully illustrates how public transport can be integrated with urban development. Bus-only roads can also be adapted to vehicle guidance systems, whereby the bus is not steered but controlled by lateral wheels, with the resumption of conventional control when the public road network is re-entered.
Such systems have been adopted in Adelaide and experiments have been made
in many other cities (Adelaide Transit Authority, 1988). The bus can also
be given further advantages in city centres where major retailing and 
transport complexes are being redeveloped. The construction of covered 
shopping malls and precincts can incorporate bus facilities for shoppers, and reconstruction of rail stations can also allow bus services to be integrated more closely with rail facilities.
The ‘park-and-ride’ system, now adopted by many European cities, enables 
the number of cars entering city centres to be reduced, particularly at 
weekend shopping peak periods. Large car-parks, either temporary or 
permanent according to need, on the urban fringe are connected by bus 
with city centres, with charges generally lower than central area parking 
costs.The advantages of the bus over the car as an efficient carrier are 
secured, and the costs of providing the fringe car-parks are much less 
than in inner-city zones.
</p>
<h2>4. Parking Restrictions:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
As we have seen, it is not possible to provide sufficient space for all 
who might like to drive and park in the central areas of large towns. 
Parking thus must be restricted and this is usually done by banning 
all-day parking by commuters or making it prohibi­tively expensive. 
Restrictions are less severe – off-peak, so that shoppers and other 
short-term visitors who benefit the economy of the centre are not 
deterred. Separate arrangements must be made for local residents, perhaps 
through permits or reserved parking.City authorities can thus control 
public car-parking places, but many other spaces are privately owned by 
businesses and reserved for particular employees. The effect of this is 
to perpetuate commuting to work by car. The future provision of such 
space can be limited through planning permission for new developments, 
as is done in London, but controlling the use of existing private spaces 
raises problematical issues of rights and freedoms that many countries are 
reluctant to confront.Overall, parking restrictions have the advantage 
of being simple to administer, flexible in application and easily 
under­stood by the public. Their Achilles’ heel is enforcement, for 
motorists are adept at parking where and when they should not and evading fines once caught.
Fines in many cities are so low that being caught once or twice a week 
works out cheaper than paying the parking charge. Indeed, in London in 
1982, a survey showed that illegal parkers outnumbered legal ones and only
60 per cent of the fines were ever paid. Parking controls have to be 
stringent and be enforced if they are to make any significant contribution to reducing congestion in the city.
</p>
<h2>5. Promoting the Bicycle:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
The benefits of cycling have long been recognised. The bicycle is cheap to 
buy and run and is in urban areas often the quickest door-to-door mode 
(Figure 5.3). It is a benign form of transport, being noiseless, 
non-polluting, energy-and space-efficient and non-threatening to most 
other road users. A pro-cycling city would promote fitness among cyclists 
and health among non-cyclists. Cycling is thus a way of providing 
mobility, which is cheap.Advocates of Environmental Traffic Management (ETM) frequently cast envious glances at the Netherlands, where cycle planning is set in the context of national planning for sustainability. The Master Plan Bicycle, which aims to increase bicycle-kilometers by at least 30 per cent between 1986 and 2010, not only tackles the traditional concerns of cycle infra­structure and road safety, but also addresses issues of mobility and modal choice; how to encourage businesses to improve the role of the bicycle in commuting; reducing bicycle theft and increasing parking quantity and quality; improving the combi­nation of cycling and public transport; and promoting consideration of the bicycle amongst influential decision makers. These ‘pull’ measures are part of a national transport strategy of discouraging car use, which ‘pushes’ motorists towards use of the bicycle.
Travel Time in Urban Areas from Door-to-Door
</p>
<h2>6. Encouraging Walking:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
Walking is the most important mode of transport in cities, yet frequently 
data on it are not collected and many planners do not think of it as a form of transport. As a result of this neglect, facilities provided specifically for walking are often either absent or badly maintained and pedestrians form the largest single category of road user deaths. There are social, medical, environmental and economic reasons for promoting walking, for it is an equitable, healthy, non-polluting and inexpensive form of transport. Moreover, ‘foot cities’ tend to be pleasurable places in which to live, with access to facilities within walking distance frequently cited as a key indicator of neighbourhood quality of life.
</p>
<h2>7. Promoting Public Transport:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">
If ETM aims to shift trips away from cars, then attractive alter­natives are required. Cycling and walking may be appropriate for the shorter distances, but transferring longer trips requires that a good quality public transport system is in place to ensure that the city can function efficiently.
This means that:<br> 
<ol style="font-size:22px;">
   <li> Fares need to be low enough for poor people to be able to afford them;</li>
   <li> There must be sufficient vehicles for a frequent service to be run throughout the day;</li>
    <li>  Routes must reflect the dominant desire lines of the travelling public and there should be extensive spatial coverage of the city so that no one is very far from a public transport stop;</li>
    <li>  Speeds of buses need to be raised relative to cars by freeing them from congestion;</li>
            <li>It is not enough to provide public transport: it also has to be coordinated. Multi-modal tickets may be one essential ingredient of a functional urban transport system, but the key item is the integration of services by the provision of connections between modes.</li>
    </ol>
</p><br>
<h2>8. Other Measures:</h2><br> 
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;"><br>

Some of the other measures useful for urban transport planning are:<br>
