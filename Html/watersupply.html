            <span class="questions">What is water drainage?</span><br>
            <p class="answer"><b>The removal of excess water either from the ground surface or from the rootzone</b>, is called drainage. Excess water may be caused by rainfall or by using too much irrigation water, but may also have other origins such as canal seepage or floods. In very dry areas there is often accumulation of salts in the soil.</p>

            <span class="questions">What is the purpose of water supply?</span><br>
            <p class="answer">A water supply system delivers water from sources to customers, and provides services vital to the function of an industrialized society and important to emergency response and recovery after disastrous events (e.g., earthquakes).</p>

<h3>1. Dead-end or Tree Distribution System</h3>
<p>In this type of water distribution system, one main pipeline runs through the center of the building, and the sub-mains branch lines off from both sides.
    </p>
<h3>Advantages of Dead-end Distribution System</h3>

<p>The design of pipe laying is simple and easy.
A less number of cut-off valves are required and the operation and maintenance cost is low.
Pipe laying is simple and no skilled labor is required.
Disadvantages of Dead-end Distribution System
</p>

<p>
    * The system is less successful in maintaining satisfactory pressure in high-rise buildings and is therefore not favored in modern waterworks practice.<br><br>
* Only one pipe provides the water to the entire building which is quite risky. <br><br>
* The head loss is relatively high, requiring a larger pipe diameter and need pumping units.<br><br>
* The discharge available during firefighting is limited due to high head loss in the piping system.<br>
The water pressure available is also lower which requires a pumping system.
</p>
<h3>2. Gridiron Distribution System</h3>
<p>In this, the main supply lines run through the center of the building, and sub mains branch off in perpendicular directions. The branch interconnects the sub-mains.

The distinguishing features of this system are that all types of pipes are interconnected and there are no dead ends.

Water can reach at the given point of withdrawal from many directions, which allows more flexible operation, particularly when repairs are required.
</p>


<h3>Grid Iron- Water Distribution System</h3>

<h3>Advantages of Gridiron Distribution System</h3>

<p>
    * This system enables the free circulation of water, without any stagnation or sediment deposit. <br><br>
* Because of the fewer interconnections water is available at every point with minimum loss of head. <br><br>
* Adequate water is available with pressure for firefighting requirements from the various branch lines.
During repair, only a few houses are affected.
Disadvantages of Gridiron Distribution System <br><br>


* In this system, more cut-off valves are required.
This system requires longer pipe lengths with larger diameters.
The analysis of discharge, pressure, and velocity in the pipes is difficult and cumbersome.
As more pipes are required, ultimately increases the cost of the distribution system.
</p>
<h3>3. Circular or Ring Distribution System</h3>
<p>* In this types of water distribution system, the supply mains forms a ring around the area. The branch pipes are connected cross-wise to the mains and also to each other. <br><br>

* This system is most reliable for several buildings located in the same area planned locations. <br><br>

<h3> 4 Types of Water Distribution System | Advantages & Disadvantages Water Supply Distribution System</h3>
<h4>Ring Water Distribution System</h4>

<h3>Advantages of Circular or Ring Distribution System</h3>

<p>* The number of interconnection is less with minimum loss of head.
The discharge is also higher when compared to other methods of distribution. <br><br>
* Fewer consumers are affected at the time of repairs as separate main lines available for each household <br><br>

<h3>Disadvantages of Circular or Ring Distribution System</h3>

* The length of pipe laying is more which ultimately leads to higher cost.
Several valves are required to control the flow and discharge of water.
</p>
<h3>4. Radial Distribution System:</h3>
<p>
* In this types of water distribution system, the whole buildings are divided into several distribution areas. <br>

* Each building has a centrally located elevated reservoir from where distribution pipes run radially towards the periphery of the distribution areas. <br><br>

* This system gives swift service, without much loss of head.
* The design of the pipe laying system is much simpler.
