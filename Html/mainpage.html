            A Review of Housing Problems
            Abstract— Housing problems occur both in rich and poor
            communities across the globe. The objective of this
            research is to review housing problems which lead to
            unwholesome environmental conditions. The method used
            is a review of academic articles, textbooks, internet
            materials, news articles and publicly available materials
            on housing problems. Previous authors whose works were
            reviewed have a convergent view on housing problems
            including overcrowding and congestion, poor
            accessibility, substandard and inadequate housing, high
            cost of building materials, high interest rate and lack of
            interest by financial institutions to facilitate loans to
            investors and uncoordinated policies by government. The
            paper made the following recommendations: (1)
            government should build low-cost houses to cater for the
            large number of people who, due to their low-income
            earnings could not afford a decent apartment; (2)
            formulation of economic, social and environmental
            policies that facilitate housing that is both affordable and
            sustainable by government; (3) improvement of sanitation
            in poor neighborhoods with poor housing conditions
            through urban renewal programme.

                <div class="answers">
                Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and dysentery, as well as typhoid, intestinal worm infections and polio. Poor exacerbates stunting and contributes to the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

                Under Sustainable Development Goal 6, “safely managed” sanitation is defined as the “use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.” Basic sanitation is defined as “use of improved facilities that are not shared

                <div class="answers">
                Result in an unhealthy environment contaminated by human waste. Without proper sanitation facilities, waste from infected individuals can contaminate a community's land and water, increasing the risk of infection for other individuals. Proper waste disposal can slow the infection cycle of many disease-causing agents.</p>

                <div class="answers">
                Urban air contamination is a serious problem in many of the planet's big cities. Intense and unremitting traffic, together with uncontrolled factory emissions, convert city air worldwide into authentic clouds of smog.<br>

                Vehicle emissions, fuel oils and natural gas to heat homes, by-products of manufacturing and power generation, particularly coal-fueled power plants, and fumes from chemical production are the primary sources of human-made air pollution.<br>
