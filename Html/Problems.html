                <span class="questions">What is water pollution?</span>
                <br>

<p>Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies such as lakes, rivers, oceans and so on, getting dissolved in them, lying suspended in the water or depositing on the bed. This degrades the quality of water.</p>

<p>Not only does this spell disaster for aquatic ecosystems, the pollutants also seep through and reach the groundwater, which might end up in our households as contaminated water we use in our daily activities, including drinking.</p>

<h1>Sources and effects of water pollution</h1>

<p>Water pollution can be caused in a number of ways, one of the most polluting being city sewage and industrial waste discharge. Indirect sources of water pollution include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rain.Soils and groundwaters contain the residue of human agricultural practices and also improperly disposed of industrial wastes.</p>

<h1>6 Ways to Prevent Water Pollution</h1>

<ul>
 <li>* Pick up litter and throw it away in a garbage can.</li>
<li>* Blow or sweep fertilizer back onto the grass if it gets onto paved areas. Don't put fertilizer on the grass right before it rains. The chemicals will wash into storm drains and waterways.</li>
<li>* Mulch or compost ${grass or yard waste}. Or, leave it in your yard if you can't compost. Don't blow leaves into the street. This clogs and damages storm drains.</li>
<li>* Wash your car or outdoor equipment where it can flow to a gravel or grassy area instead of a street.</li>
<li>* Don't pour your motor oil down the storm drain. Take it to the nearest auto parts store. It's free!</li>
<li>* Never clean up a spill by hosing it into a storm drain. Place kitty litter, sand, or another absorbent on the spill. Once the liquid becomes solid - sweep it up and throw it in a garbage can. </li>

</ul>

<h1>Air pollution in cities</h1>
<p>
    <span class="questions">What Causes Air Pollution?</span><br>
   <p> The Short Answer:
Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols.</p>

<p> Abstract
Air quality in cities is the result of a complex interaction between natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions. Air pollution in cities is a serious environmental problem – especially in the developing countries. The air pollution path of the urban atmosphere consists of emission and transmission of air pollutants resulting in the ambient air pollution. Each part of the path is influenced by different factors. Emissions from motor traffic are a very important source group throughout the world. During transmission, air pollutants are dispersed, diluted and subjected to photochemical reactions. Ambient air pollution shows temporal and spatial variability. As an example of the temporal variability of urban air pollutants caused by motor traffic, typical average annual, weekly and diurnal cycles of NO, NO2, O3 and Ox are presented for an official urban air-quality station in Stuttgart, southern Germany. They are supplemented by weekly and diurnal cycles of selected percentile values of NO, NO2, and O3. Time series of these air pollutants give information on their trends. Results are discussed with regard to air pollution conditions in other cities. Possibilities for the assessment of air pollution in cities are shown. In addition, a qualitative overview of the air quality of the world's megacities is given.

</ul>
  
<p>
   <h3>Use public transportation</h3>
<p>Public buses, trams, subways, and trains are not only more affordable than driving your own car, they also help cut congestion and reduce air pollution. Oftentimes, there are discounts for children, students, seniors, and weekly/monthly/yearly passes. Rather than having to use a ticket machine or a counter, many cities now provide the option of getting e-tickets through their app. Check the website of your local public transport service for the  details!</p>

<h3>Walk and cycle more</h3>
<p>Aside from the fact that walking and cycling produce zero emissions, these actions are also good for your health, so you can get a workout out of travelling! Don’t have a bike? Rent one! Services like Call a Bike (Germany) and BimBimBikes (worldwide) connect individuals with bike rental platforms so that you can procure one with ease.</p>

<p>Carpool or ride-share
Know someone who regularly drives to the same locations as you do? Travelling together in a single vehicle can reduce emissions, fuel costs, and traffic congestion. Don’t have anyone to carpool with? You could find a group on Facebook, or apps such as Waze Carpool (Brazil, Israel, Mexico, U.S.) and BlaBlaCar (Europe) allow you to commute with people on their daily routes as well as on road trips between cities!
</p>

<h3>Use an electric vehicle</h3>
<p> If you really need to drive your own vehicle, consider investing in an electric car. There are options to be found in all major brands on the market today. Electric cars are more cost-effective in the long run due to lower maintenance fees, tax incentives, and low electricity costs when compared to traditional petrol or diesel cars. Other pros include zero emissions, quiet driving, and fast and convenient home charging. If going fully electric doesn’t sound appealing, try a hybrid car. These vehicles combine a diesel or petrol engine with an electric one motor, allowing you to use both options or switch between them while on the road. Hybrid vehicles consume less fuel and produce less emissions than a regular car. 
    </p>

<h3>Buy local products and produce</h3>
<p>Shopping local means that the food had to travel less to where you are, thus decreasing transport emissions. Aside from the environmental benefits, you gain control over what you eat by knowing where the food comes from and how it was produced. You can also feel good about supporting local businesses! Products made close to home are usually highlighted on the packaging at your local supermarket. You are also able to find them by connecting with your community at your resident farmer’s market!</p>

<h3>Join urban gardening initiatives</h3>
<p>Urban gardening initiatives come in a variety of forms – backyard beekeeping, vertical and rooftop gardening, local farms – but what ties them together is the community. Benefits of joining one include positive social interaction, increased food security, efficient utilization of space, and access to fresher, healthier food. Carbon emissions are reduced from the plants you’re growing themselves and from the fact that the food didn’t have to travel to where you are! 
</p>

<h3>Adopt green roofs for your house or your factory</h3>
<p>A green roof is a vegetative layer grown on rooftops. They purify the air, serve as a habitat for local animals, reduce ambient noise from outside, slow stormwater runoff, provide insulation in the winter and protect the house from heat in the summer. While all green roofs function similarly, the actual installation will depend on the region, climate, building, type, and design.

Those with a lot more space to offer could alternatively install solar panels on their roofs. These will not only power your buildings with clean, renewable energy, but you could even sell the excess power produced back into the grid!</p>

<h3>Switch to a renewable energy plan</h3>
<p>Changing energy suppliers for your house means that the power you use in your daily life will be changed from coal, oil, and natural gas to that of sun, wind, and water. Not only will you reduce your carbon footprint by doing so, but renewable energy is usually cheaper! Save the environment and your wallet by looking for clean energy companies near you today!
</p>

<h3>Write to your city government to ask about air quality data and clean air actions</h3>
<p>
Air quality data is usually handled by a department of your city’s, state’s or country’s environmental agency. You can find our about the local air quality levels of your neighborhood by going to your regional or federal government website. Ideally, you will get information on how the measurements are gathered, current policies on curbing air pollution, trends in air quality, and much more. However, air quality data is traditionally gathered only at a few limited locations. This means that the location of the next monitoring station with available data is most likely far away from the places that matter most to you.  
</p>

<h3>By writing to your local environmental agency</h3>
<p>you may be able to receive modelled data applicable directly to the locations of your interest – for instance, where you live, where you work or where your children go to school. If they are not able to provide this information, you can also write to the politicians representing your neighborhood or in your city council. Every inquiry is important and will register as rising citizen interest in the topic of air quality. If more citizens show an active interest in data about air quality and clean air actions, city officials are more likely to take action by increasing the number of measurement locations and by proposing legislation to curb emissions.


There are also various initiatives targeting air pollution that require the assistance of citizens. You can find these on portals like the Urban Innovative Actions (Europe), or you can write to your government office for clean air actions that you can take part in.
</p>

<h3>Become an air quality sensor host</h3>
<p>
By volunteering to install an air quality sensor on your own premises, you help provide comprehensive air quality information for governments and fellow citizens in making decisions on improving the air we breathe. There are no costs incurred for becoming a sensor host aside from the sensors’ very low power consumption. The gathered air quality data will be publicly available on our citizen portal. Join us in helping clear the air today!

<h1>solid waste pollution</h1>

    Solid waste issue: Sources, composition, disposal, recycling, and valorization
</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Solid waste management issue is the biggest challenge to the authorities of both small and large cities’ in developing countries. This is mainly due to the increasing generation of such solid waste and the burden posed on the municipal budget. In addition to the high costs, the solid waste management is associated lack of understanding over different factors that affect the entire handling system. An analysis of literature and reported related to waste management in developing countries, showed that few articles supplied quantitative information. The objective of the mentioned studies was to determine the stakeholders’ action/behavior that have a role in the solid waste management and to analyze different factors that affect the system. The studies carried out in 4 continents, in 22 developing countries and on more than thirty urban areas. A combination of variable methods that were used in this study was mentioned in details in order to encourage the stakeholders and to assess the factors influencing the performance of the solid waste management in the studied cities [1].

Population increase, rapid urbanization, booming economy, and the rise in the standard of living in developing countries have greatly accelerated the rate, amount and quality of the municipal solid waste generation [2].

</p>

<h2>2. Sources, composition and characterization of the solid waste</h2>
<p>
    unicipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the important challenges to the environment. Municipalities; generally; are responsible for the waste management. They have to provide an effective and efficient system to the inhabitants. Nevertheless, they are; often; facing with many problems beyond the ability of the municipal authority to handle the MSW [3]. This is essentially due to financial resources, lack of organization and complexity [4].

The composition of MSW varies significantly from one municipality to another and from country to country significantly. Such variation depends mainly on the life style, economic situation, waste management regulations and industrial structure. The quantity and the composition of the municipal solid waste are critical for the determination of the appropriate handling and management of these wastes. Such information is essential and useful to put up the solid waste to energy conversion facility within the municipality. Based on the calorific value and the elemental composition of MSW the engineers and scientists can decide upon its utility as a fuel. Meanwhile, such information will help in predicting the makeup of gaseous emissions. Thereafter, this MSW is subjected to the energy conversion technologies including gasification, incineration etc. However, the possible hazardous substances occurring in the ash should be considered carefully [5]. In this respect, the composition of the waste will provide valuable information on the utility of the material for either composting or for biogas production as fuel via biological conversion [6].

Meanwhile, the time has a great effect on the composition of MSW. Biodegradation of such MSW according to the time is an important factor that governs the amount of recyclable material particularly the organic contents. The EPA estimated the amount of MSW generation in the United States with 254 million tons in 2013 [7]. The composition and classification by material of such MSW is given in Fig. 1.



Household or municipal wastes are usually generated from variable sources where different human activities are encountered. Several studies reported that the municipal solid waste that are generated from the developing countries are mainly from households (55–80%), followed by market or commercial areas (10–30%). The later consists of variable quantities generated from industries, streets, institutions and many others [8]. Generally, solid waste from such sources is highly; heterogeneous in nature. Thus, they have variable physical and chemical characteristics depending on their original sources. Their composition are yard waste, food waste, plastics, wood, metals, papers, rubbers, leather, batteries, inert materials, textiles, paint containers, demolishing and construction materials as well as many others that would be difficult to classify. The heterogeneity of such generated solid waste is the major setback in sorting and its utilization as material. Therefore, there is a proper need for fractionation and sorting of these wastes before any meaningful treatment process. Sorting and separating of such wastes are one of the most important and traditional methods as essential steps in solid waste management to provide data on the quality of the separated fractions for any potential utilization. Nevertheless, the success of any designed for solid waste segregation depends mainly on the public awareness and the active participation of such waste generators in the different communities (i.e., how they follow the fundamental and principles of waste sorting and separation) [9].

Solid waste generation (SWG) is a problematic and is an issue of concern everywhere in the world, particularly in all urban centers. Such SWG is considered one of the most challenging issues faced by most developing countries that suffer from sever environmental pollution problems caused by the large quantities of SWG [10]. Increased generation of solid waste in urban cities affected dramatically on the sanitary related problems and the basic services such as sanitation facilities, water supply, waste management, and transport infrastructure [11].



<h2>3. Disposal of solid waste</h2>

<p>It has been reported that improper bin collection practices, collection, transfer and/or transport systems have great effect on the characteristics of the solid wastes. Besides, the poor route of planning, lack of information concerning the collection schedule [33], number of vehicles for solid waste collection and poor roads [34] and insufficient infrastructure [35] can also effect of the characteristics’ of the solid wastes. The effective ways and affordable waste collection services were studied and reported by Sharholy et al. [36]. To organize the informal sector and promoting micro-enterprises. Knowledge of treatment by authorities is one of the important factors affecting the handling of solid waste [37]. Factors influence household waste disposal were analyzed by Tadesse et al. [38]. Their results indicated that the supply of waste facilities significantly affects the choice of waste disposal. They reported that the inadequate supply of waste containers as well as the longer distance of transporting these containers increases the possibility of dumping such wastes in open areas and roadsides along the trip. Pokhrel and Viraraghavan [39] mentioned that insufficient financial resources, absence of legislation, well equipped, and engineered landfills all contribute to the limitation of solid waste safe disposal.
</p>

<h2>4. Management and recycling of solid waste</h2>
<p>
    In terms of pricing for solid waste disposal, Scheinberg et al., reported that there are indications that high rates of recovery for recycling are associated with tipping fees at the site of disposal [57]. High disposal pricing has the positive effect on recovering the generated solid waste. This goes to the beneficial reuse or the value chains of solid waste. Gonzalez-Torre and Adenso-Diaz mentioned that social influences, altruistic and regulatory factors are important reasons why certain communities can develop strong recycling habits [58]. The author also reported that people who frequently go to dispose their general refuse in the bins are more likely to recycle certain products at home. In most cases, as the distance to the recycling bins decreases, the number of fractions that people separate, sort and collect their solid waste at home increases. Minghua et al. added that in order to increase the recycling rates, the local government must encourage the markets for the recycled materials and should increase the professionals in the recycling companies [2]. Further important factors were mentioned by other scholars including a financial support for different recycling projects [59], to support the infrastructure of the recycling companies in their country [34]. Other investigators suggested to drop-off and buy back centers [60]. Sharholy et al. [36] suggested organizing informal sector for solid waste recycling [36].
    
    Indeed, MSW collection and disposal is a one of the major problem of urban environment in most countries worldwide today. MSW management solutions must be financially sustainable, technically feasible, socially and legally acceptable as well as environmentally friendly. European policy, presently, is pushing to adapt several rational managements towards the natural resources. Today, waste valorization is a promising technological perspective. It becomes a process that is possible through sorting the MSW at the source, and to combine with material recycling as well as waste-to-energy generation methods. However, technologies like disposal or mechanical sorting of the MSW in landfills do not improve the MSW management efficiently. Therefore, landfills must be the ultimate disposal site of the MSW. Nevertheless, construction of conventional landfills for MSW disposal is still going on in many countries. It was reported by Hadjibiros et al. [61] that site selection of the landfill is extremely important due to the lack of public acceptance that result several social problems [61].
    
    For sustainable management of solid waste, effective planning and development strategies about the quantity and categories of such wastes are of great importance. Thus the most important processes are quantification and characterization of all the sustainable solid waste management systems according to Senzige, et al. [62]. At a particular place, studying the composition and the categories of solid waste is important for integrating technologies including recycling and resource recovery in the concerned solid waste management systems. The information also can certainly assist in infrastructure, policy development, and planning for any sizing decisions concerning the integrated solid waste management program [63].
    
    

</p>
<h2>5. Valorization of solid waste</h2>
<p>
    Increasingly tighter regulations in terms of organic solid waste, as well as increasing the demand for renewable chemicals and fuels, recently, are pushing the industrial manufacturers and the environmentalists toward higher sustainability to improve cost-effectiveness and meet customers’ demand. During the past few years, valorization of food organic waste is one of the important current research areas. It has attracted a great deal of attention as a potential alternative to the conventional solid waste disposal of a wide range of residues in landfill sites. In addition, the increasing development of environmental strategies to process such solid waste is an interesting area of increasing importance in our current society. The conventional landfill, incineration and composting ways of handling solid wastes are common as mature technologies for waste disposal. Nevertheless, they are not satisfactory to treating organic waste. The disadvantages are: high energy consumption, generation of toxic methane gas and bad odor, as well as slow reaction kinetics. Research efforts, in fact, have also been directed to the novel technologies towards the decomposition of organic waste. But, no valuable product is generated from such decomposition process. The recent research has focused on producing energy from the food waste instead of disposing and decomposing (e.g., bioethanol and biodiesel production). Meanwhile, useful organic chemicals can be generated from organic waste via bio-refinery or white biotechnology (e.g., bio plastics and/or succinic) as well as developing sustainable green production strategies

<h2>NOISE POLLUTION</h2>
<h3>Noise pollution is one of the biggest health risks in city life</h3>
<p>
    Noise is one of the biggest pollutants in modern cities but the risk is often overlooked despite being linked to an increased risk of early death, according to research conducted by scientists.

    Noise is one of the biggest pollutants in modern cities but the risk is often overlooked despite being linked to an increased risk of early death, according to research conducted by scientists.
    ‘Noise produces a stimulus to the central nervous system and this stimulus releases some hormones,’ said Dr David Rojas from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain. ‘(This) increases the risk of hypertension, and hypertension has been related with many other cardiovascular (and) cerebrovascular diseases like infarction (heart attacks) and strokes.’ 
    
    He was speaking in Brussels, Belgium, on 23 May at the annual Green Week conference, part of a Europe-wide event to help people swap best practices on environmental activities and policies. This year’s focus is how the EU is helping cities to become better places to live and work. 
    
    Dr Rojas, an environmental health researcher, says that despite the fact that noise pollution is a major public health problem in cities – and, in fact, beats air pollution as a risk factor in Barcelona – there is a tendency to overlook the problem because we can tune it out.
    
 
</p>
<p>
<span class="questions">How to Reduce Noise Pollution?</span><br>
We can Reduce Noise pollution by turning off appliances when not in use, use of earplugs, lowering the volume, planting more trees, regular maintenance of vehicles and machines etc. By controlling noise we can control negative health effects that noise pollution has on everyone.
<p>
<h3> Shut the Door when using noisy Machines</h3>
<p>
We can shut the door after we turn on dishwashers or washing machines for rooms where it is kept or we can turn them on before leaving the house so that overlapping of exposure to loud noises can be reduced
</p>

<h3>Stay away from Noisy area</h3>
<p>Noise producing industries, airports, vehicles should be far from residential areas as it is very dangerous for infants and senior citizens.</p>


<h3>Control Noise level near sensitive areas</h3>
<p>There should be control on noise level (Silent zones) near schools, hospitals. Place noise limits boards near sensitive areas.
    </p>

    <h3>Go Green by planning trees</h3>
    <p>Plant trees
        We can plant more trees as they are good noise absorbents. According to studies, it can reduce noise by 5 to 10 decibels Db around them.
        </p>

        <h3>proper Lubraication to reduce noise</h3>
        <p>We can use proper lubrication as well as better maintenance of machines to reduce noise pollution and improve efficiency. It reduces friction between movable parts and helps to reduce noise.</p>
