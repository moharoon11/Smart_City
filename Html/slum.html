<h2>Homelessness:</h2><br>
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">Homelessness is a complex problem; the circumstances of homeless people vary greatly. Homelessness is sometimes
a product of shortage of houses, but in some cases homeless­ness is caused due to other reasons also.</p><br>

<h2><u>1. Urban Sprawl:</u></h2><br>
<p style="max-width:85%; font-size:22px;">Urban sprawl or real expansion of the cities, both in population and geographical area, of rapidly growing cities 
is the root cause of urban problems. In most cities the economic base is incapable of dealing with the problems <br>
created by their excessive size. Massive immigration from rural areas as well as from small towns into big cities 
has taken place almost consistently; thereby adding to the size of cities.<br>
<br> <br>
The first large flow of migration from rural to urban areas was during the “depression” of late 1930s when people
migrated in search of jobs. Later, during the decade 1941-51, another a million persons moved to urban places in <br>
response to wartime industrialisation and partition of the country in 1947.
<br><br>
During 1991-2001, well over<b> 20 million people</b> migrated to cities. The greatest pressure of the immigrating<br> 
population has been felt in the central districts of the city (the old city) where the immigrants flock to 
their relatives and friends before they search for housing. Population densities beyond the “old city” decline sharply.<br>
<br><br>
Brush (1968) has referred to this situation in the central parts of the cities as “urban impulsion” which results 
from concentration of people in the <i>centre</i> of the city close to their work and shopping. Incidentally many of the <br>
fastest growing urban centres are large cities.
